/// [AppConfig] is a configuration class used to define global settings for the app.
/// It holds various properties related to theming, localization, routing, and performance settings.
/// This class is designed to be passed into the `CoreSetup` widget to configure the application
/// at a high level. It allows developers to customize various aspects of the app's appearance,
/// behavior, and debugging settings.
///
/// This configuration class facilitates setting up key app settings such as themes, localization,
/// routing behavior, and debugging tools. It provides a flexible and scalable way to manage app-wide settings
/// by using optional parameters. Each parameter serves a specific purpose, allowing developers to fine-tune
/// the user experience and ensure optimal performance across different app configurations.
///
/// **Constructor Parameters:**
/// - [theme]: The theme data for the app, allowing customization of the app's visual style. If not provided,
///   the app will use the default system theme.
/// - [appTitle]: The title of the app, which is displayed in the `MaterialApp` widget.
/// - [localizationsDelegates]: A list of localization delegates for enabling multi-language support.
/// - [supportedLocales]: A list of locales supported by the app for localization purposes.
/// - [initialRoute]: The initial route to navigate to when the app is launched. If not provided, the app
///   will use the default `/` route.
/// - [onGenerateRoute]: A custom function for generating routes based on the app's needs. Useful for handling
///   dynamic routes or adding route parameters.
/// - [navigatorObservers]: A list of navigator observers that track navigation events in the app. These can
///   be used for logging, analytics, or custom behavior based on navigation.
/// - [color]: The primary color of the app, typically used in app icons and UI elements for branding purposes.
/// - [onUnknownRoute]: A custom handler for unknown routes that do not match any defined routes. Useful for
///   providing a fallback route when the user navigates to an undefined path.
/// - [showPerformanceOverlay]: A flag to enable or disable the performance overlay for debugging. This overlay
///   displays performance metrics such as frame rendering times, helping developers monitor the app's performance.
/// - [showSemanticsDebugger]: A flag to enable or disable the semantics debugger for accessibility testing.
///   This is useful for developers who want to ensure the app is accessible to all users, particularly those
///   using screen readers.
/// - [checkerboardRasterCacheImages]: A flag to enable or disable the checkerboard raster cache images for
///   debugging. This feature helps to identify performance bottlenecks related to rasterization of images.
/// - [checkerboardOffscreenLayers]: A flag to enable or disable the checkerboard offscreen layers for debugging.
///   This helps to detect issues with offscreen rendering layers, such as those involved in animations or scrolling.
